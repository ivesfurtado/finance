Inside this repo you will find several scripts applied to stocks on IBOVESPA (the brazilian stock index).

There are scripts applied using Value Investing and Momentum Investing.

These are the core skills I apply on those scripts:
* WebScraping with *BeautifulSoup*
* Data manipulation and visualization with *Pandas*
* Mathematical operations with *numpy*
